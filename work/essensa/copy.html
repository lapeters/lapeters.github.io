<p>A client requested a refresh of their current homepage so the entirety of my work was done using a custom page template and independently enqueued styles and scripts. Their site was built in WordPress, so I used the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to configure custom blocks of flexible content in the page editor for easy asset swapping and editing.</p>
<p>The page features several content sliders built with the Swiper.js plugin. Slides can be added, removed, or reorganized within the page editor. The procedure section contains content cards tiled using Flexbox and Bootstrap that can be added, removed, and reorganized as well.</p>
