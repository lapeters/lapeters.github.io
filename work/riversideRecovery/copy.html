<p>This project is unique because I wasn’t working off of a Photoshop or XD mockup which is typical for my projects. Instead, I was charged with converting their current site to WordPress.</p>

<p>The site is built using Bootstrap 4’s grid system and modal features. Each page had a unique design and layout which meant I needed to create flexible content blocks that could adapt to the differing characteristics of every page. I used the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to create the content blocks with different content fields and options to select. Then I used the WordPress loop within a template part to iterate over every chosen block and output markup depending on the options selected. Now assets and layouts could be changed within the editor for easy maintenance.</p>
