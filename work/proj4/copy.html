<p>This is the landing page where all special issues and featured content can be found for the Daily 49er newspaper during the spring 2016 semester.The page is built on a custom WordPress theme using the HTML5 Blank template and Twitter Bootstrap framework for responsiveness. The site also displays individual articles that were featured for their newsworthiness or in-depth reporting. Those sites were made using a WordPress parallax plugin called Parallax Gravity.</p>

<p>All websites are hosted on a Dream Host virtual private server in order to use wildcard subdomains for every special issues site. I also performed management of the hosting.</p>
