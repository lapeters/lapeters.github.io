<p>I built a website for the Daily 49er newspaper's first special issue of the Spring 2016 semester: exploring the Long Beach, CA music scene. The issue included band features, venue spotlights, and a live music crawl to four shows around the city. The site is build on a custom WordPress theme with the HTML5 Blank template and the <strong>Twitter Bootstrap</strong> framework. The site also includes embeded video, responsive images, and an interactive map of historic music landmarks.</p>

<p>The design was meant to showcase the vibrant imagery of performance shots and band portraits.  On the cover page, I created an image map of a sound-wave with different segments of the wave linking to a story. Each article in the issue represents a different tone in the collective rhythm of the Long Beach music scene. I wanted the navigation of the site to reflect that unity and amalgam.</p>
