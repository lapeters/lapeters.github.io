<p>This homepage redesign was built previously using WordPress so I configured a custom page editor for the front page using the Advanced Custom Fields plugin and a template file within the theme.<p>
<p>Some functionality I developed for the homepage includes a video gallery with a lightbox feature, a slider of patient photos and testimonials, text blocks for facts and certifications about the doctor, a grid of procedures, and a before and after gallery. The site utilizes the Bootstrap 4 framework, Swiper.js, and Lozad.js for lazy loading images and video in order to improve page performance.</p>
