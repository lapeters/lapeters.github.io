<p>This project from my time at <a href="https://www.incrediblemarketing.com/" target="_blank">Incredible Marketing</a> required a 2-day turnaround with the promise of more sites to come in the future with a similar design. So this presented the challenge to create a theme in a short time frame while also building in the functionality that allowed for easy colors and assets swapping for other sites down the line.</p>
<p>I achieved that by using a child theme with StrapPress as its parent. I also built a theme options page and flexible content blocks in the page editors using the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. Content, images, and classes can be edited and changed within the different blocks in the page editor then called within a custom loop built in the page template file. Background images are changed via HTML attributes and jQuery without having to edit any CSS.</p>
