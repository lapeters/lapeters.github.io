<p>This was one of the first projects I completed during my time at Incredible Marketing. The site is built with a custom WordPress theme that utilizes Bootstrap 4 for grid structure and base styling. While the homepage and inner page templates are comprised of flexible content blocks created using the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. The blocks have individual markup and fields for custom content. The blocks are called via WordPress loop in the pageâ€™s template file.</p>

<p>The theme also features a theme options page where colors, logos, social buttons, and other global settings can be changed dynamically. Sliders are built with the Owl Carousel JavaScript plugin.</p>
