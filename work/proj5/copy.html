<p>While developing this site I was able to test run a theme boilerplate I helped develop to standardize processes and increase efficiency. The boilerplate applied a lot of the common practices Iâ€™ve used on other sites. The site design was broken up into blocks of content with those blocks turned into flexible content fields using the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. This essentially meant each block was grouped with unique fields and settings with independent markup and styles in the template files. Background images, colors, and font styles could be chosen in the page editor and applied to the site using jQuery. This strategy took inspiration from other page editors common in WordPress themes but with a lot less bloat and rigid settings. CSS was processed using Sass and Bootstrap 4 was used for the grid system and further standardized styling.</p>
