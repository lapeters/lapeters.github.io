<p>This website was about showcasing my work while also getting my feet wet with several new technologies. Its built using the <b>Jekyll</b> static site generator and hosted on <b>Github Pages</b>. This gives me a simple, lightweight CMS without dealing with complex databases and easier SEO implementation. Its then hosted for free using Githubâ€™s secure servers.</p>

<p>The styling utilizes <b>Sass</b>, a powerful CSS preprocessor, as well as <b>Bourbon</b> and <b>Neat</b>. Bourbon is a framework providing helpful mixins to Sass making styling simpler and much faster. While Neat is a grid structure for responsive layouts thats lighter than Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

<p>I also gained experience using <b>Gulp</b>. With this javascript task runner, I set up a live-reload plugin called Browser Sync which allowed me to develop my website and see the changes I made instantly. It also converts my Sass to CSS, minifies bulky files like CSS and Javascript, and optimizes my images for faster load times.</p>

<p>This website was a huge learning experience and one I am excited to continually update as my skills improve.</p>
