<p>This website was about showcasing my work while also getting my feet wet with several new technologies. Its built using the Jekyll static site generator and hosted on Github pages. This gives me a simple, lightweight CMS without dealing with complex databases and easier SEO implementation. Its then hosted for free using Githubâ€™s secure servers.</p>

<p>The styling utilizes Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor, as well as Bourbon and Neat. Bourbon is a framework providing helpful mixins to Sass making styling simpler and much faster. While Neat is a grid structure for responsive layouts thats lighter than Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

<p>I also gained experience using Gulp. With this javascript task runner, I set up a live-reload plugin called Browser Sync which allowed me to develop my website and see the changes I made instantly. It also converts my Sass to CSS, minifies bulky files like CSS and Javascript, and optimizes my images for faster load times.</p>

<p>This website was a huge learning experience and one I am excited to continually update as my skills improve.</p>
