<p>For the special issue featured on this website revolves around hyper local news stories from different neighborhoods around Long Beach, CA. The stories highlight the diverse population and issues around the city.</p>

<p>The site is built on a custom <strong>WordPress</strong> theme using <strong>HTML5 Blank</strong> as a template and the <strong>Twitter Bootstrap</strong>framework for responsive images and content. I also created a vector map of Long Beach, CA for the cover page that highlights, in various shades of purple, the regions covered in the issue.
