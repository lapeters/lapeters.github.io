<p>This site built during my time at <a href="https://www.incrediblemarketing.com/" target="_blank">Incredible Marketing</a> is built with a custom WordPress theme with Sass preprocessing and Gulp to handle common tasks like minification, Sass to CSS conversion, and image optimization. It also sets up live reloading through Browser Sync for an improved development process.</p>
<p>The project features custom page templates for staff, gallery, locations, contact, and procedure pages, and a gallery and testimonials slider. The site also uses the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to configure custom content blocks within the page editor.<p>
