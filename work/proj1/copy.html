<p>The last special issue of the Daily 49er newspaper for the spring 2016 semester focused Cal State Long Beach athletics. The site utilizes the <strong>WordPress</strong> content management system along with <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, and the <strong>Twitter Bootstrap</strong> framework for the content layout. I decided to use a child theme over the <strong>Longform</strong> theme developed by <a href="https://cohhe.com/" target="_blank">Cohne</a>.</p>
