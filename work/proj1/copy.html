<p>The last special issue of the Daily 49er newspaper for the spring 2016 semester focused Cal State Long Beach athletics. The site utilizes the <b>WordPress</b> content management system along with <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b>, and the <b>Twitter Bootstrap</b> framework for the content layout. I decided to use a child theme over the <b>Longform</b> theme developed by <a href="https://cohhe.com/" target="_blank">Cohne</a>.</p>
