			<p><strong>Hello, I’m Lindsay Peters.</strong> I’m an aspiring front-end developer, designer, and journalist based in Orange County, CA. </p>

			<p>I build clean, responsive websites that communicate information as clearly and straightforward as possible without sacrificing their ability to captivate. While working as a web editor and design assistant for the Daily 49er newspaper, I created dynamic sites for special issues using Wordpress. However, I also have experience developing static or single-page sites.</p>

			<p>My time developing for a daily newspaper tells you I’m used to working long hours under strict deadlines and my slumping posture will tell you I’m pretty much glued to my screen. Still, I love the work I do because it inspires my need to constantly learning and work through problems. I have a passion for figuring out what code will work best for my projects, how it works, and, most importantly, why it works best. This has helped me challenge my habits and practices in order to grow as a developer and improve with each project.</p>

			<p>Feel free to take a gander at my resume and <a href="#contact">Contact Me</a> for any front-end development positions where I can continue to learn, solve puzzles, and improve my work. All while building sites that have their own story to tell.</p>
